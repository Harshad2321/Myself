# COGNITE Logo

## Logo Placeholder

To complete the branding, please add your COGNITE logo here:

**Filename:** `cognite_logo.png`

**Specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 200x200px or 400x400px
- Style: Should incorporate:
  - Flower or garden elements
  - Purple/Lavender color scheme (#301934 to #C1A3FF)
  - Soft, rounded, comforting aesthetic
  - Clear legibility at small sizes

**Usage:**
The logo is referenced in `src/components/Navbar.jsx` and appears on every page in the top-left corner.

## Alternative (Current Implementation)
The current implementation uses a **Lucide React `Flower2` icon** inside a gradient circle as a temporary logo placeholder. This works well for the demo but can be replaced with your custom logo.

## Design Suggestions:
- A stylized flower or garden gate
- Combination mark (icon + wordmark "COGNITE")
- Calming, nostalgic feel
- Easy to recognize and remember

## If You Have a Logo:
1. Save it as `cognite_logo.png` in this directory
2. Update Navbar.jsx line ~10 to use the image instead of the icon
3. Ensure proper sizing and spacing

---

For now, the Flower2 icon serves as an effective placeholder that matches the overall theme.
